"""Unit test for phanspeed's release-signing wiring (docs/RELEASE-SIGNING.md).

phanspeed-update is now a thin wrapper over the vendored sutra_update.py
(UNIFY.md Wave A #1) — the trust-chain edge cases (tampered artifact,
unsigned-fails-closed, unarmed-degrades-hash-only) are exhaustively covered
once, in sutra's own tests/unit_update.py, not re-derived per pill. What
THIS test pins is phanspeed-specific: the shipped anchor's shape, and that
pill="phanspeed" actually produces the right principal/namespace
("phanspeed"/"phanspeed-release") when it reaches ssh-keygen — a real
throwaway (non-hardware) ed25519 key proves the roundtrip. Skips (not
fails) if ssh-keygen is unavailable. Exit 0 = pass.
