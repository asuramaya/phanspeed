# `make sync-signers` — rebuild release-signing/allowed_signers AND
# install.sh's embedded RELEASE_ALLOWED_SIGNERS twin from the fleet's
# canonical pubkeys, per ~/code/REPOS/RELEASE.md's sync-signers doctrine.
#
# Canonical key home (operator ruling 13ee52ce): ~/.ssh/asuramaya-master/ —
# OUTSIDE every repo, never committed, never a sibling checkout. This is a
# LOCAL-ONLY act by construction: CI can never reach $HOME, so CI's
# signing-sync check asserts internal consistency only (well-formed anchor +
# embedded copy matches), never canonical equality.
#
# ALWAYS a full rebuild, never an append: RA's first ceremony left 3 of 4
# keys unpinned across other repos by appending one key at a time. Refuses to
# run unless it finds exactly 4 canonical keys, so a partial/broken key home
# can't silently produce a partial anchor.
#
# SEQUENCING: this populates the anchor. Per RELEASE.md, run it ONLY in the
# same act as cutting the operator's first signed phanspeed release — arming
# release-signing/allowed_signers any earlier bricks phanspeed-update against
# every existing unsigned release.

# exactly, per RELEASE.md — "a failed build, not a warning"). Read the anchor
# file straight from disk in Python rather than round-tripping it through a

# RELEASE_ALLOWED_SIGNERS is single-quoted (install.sh) so this can span
